# AR-Sorting-Visualization


Attracting students to challenging courses is difficult, with routines decreasing comprehension and memory. "Exploro3D" addresses this
by combining augmented reality (AR) with geometry, sorting algorithms, and collaborative learning. This AR-powered platform bridges
traditional teaching and modern learning, making education immersive and interactive. "Exploro3D" enhances learning through 3D
geometric interaction, algorithm visualization, and shared virtual whiteboards, improving problem-solving skills and understanding
complex concepts. It demonstrates AR's potential to support scientific learning and effective collaboration in geometry and algorithms.

(This is just the sorting algorithm's visualization scripts )
